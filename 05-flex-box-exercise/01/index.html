          <h2>1st Law</h2>
          <p>
            A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a
            human being to come to harm

          <h2>2nd Law</h2>
          A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where
          such orders would conflict with the First Law

        <section class="law">
          <h2>3rd Law</h2>
          <p>
            A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection
            does not conflict with the First or Second Law
          </p>

        Asimov later added another rule, known as the fourth or zeroth law, that
        superseded the others. It stated that “a robot may not harm humanity,
        or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.”
